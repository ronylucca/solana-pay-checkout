This is a point-of-sale web app that allows us to take payments from customers in person. /shop checkout feature presents a QR code that customers/buyers can scan with a Solana wallet to make the payment. As soon as they do this app checkout page app will update to show that they’ve paid.

Also going to look at online payments in Solana, and build a loyalty card scheme. Tokens were mint and this app is prepared to give a unit in every order. So users have a 50% discount on every 5th purchase. Or whatever you like really, it’s super flexible. We’ll finish up with a sneak peek at some really cool upcoming Solana Pay functionality that pulls all of this together!

Here's what is built
