This is a point-of-sale web app that allows us to take payments from customers in person. /shop checkout feature presents a QR code that customers/buyers can scan with a Solana wallet to make the payment. As soon as they do this app checkout page app will update to show that they’ve paid.

/shop - demo. Charge you devnet wallet with some faucets in USDC here. And prepare you mobile Phantom wallet app to use.



Also going to look at online payments in Solana, and build a loyalty card scheme. Tokens were mint and this app is prepared to give a unit in every order. So users have a 50% discount on every 5th purchase. Or whatever you like really, it’s super flexible. We’ll finish up with a sneak peek at some really cool upcoming Solana Pay functionality that pulls all of this together!

Here's what is built
